# ng-pipes

A collection of pipes for use in Angular 2+. Currently, not available in built form, so feel free to copy and use as necessary.

## Installation

Coming soon...

## Available Pipes

Here are some brief descriptions of the currently available pipes. All names will begin with `rh` to avoid any collisions.

### rh-number-pad

Used to pad a number or string to two places. Used for padding a single digit `2` to `02`. Arbitrary length coming soon.

### rh-slice-to-str

Used to slice a string to the first occurrence of a character (or string). If is a string value is not provided, it will trim to the first space by default. If the string is not found, the full original string will be shown.

## Run tests

Project created with [Angular-CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). To run the tests, run `ng test` from the command line.
